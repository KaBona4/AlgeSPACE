    "tutorial-story-2": "But something seems to be wrong with the supermarket's digital scales; you simply can't weigh any fruit directly. You ask an employee for help. According to the employee, the digital scales only work for certain items. The ones you don't need to buy, of course.",
    "tutorial-story-3": "The employee suggests that you use a manual scale instead. But even this is not as easy as you thought, as not every fruit and vegetable has the right weight. With a little effort, you have managed to derive various equations and weight ratios using the manual scales. Can you calculate the weight for a particular item from the resulting equation systems?",

    "tutorial-scale": "In most steps, you will work with the scale shown below. The scale has two weighing pans on which you can place objects. The scale reflects the weight ratio of the objects placed on both weighing pans. In addition, the scales are equipped with a display that expresses the weight ratio of the scales as an equation or inequality. In some tasks, there are already initial objects on the scales.",
    "tutorial-items": "You can drag and drop the fruit and/or vegetables shown in the displays on the left and the weights placed on the shelf onto the scales. Please note, however, that there is only a limited quantity for each item. Furthermore, the weights can vary with each task. If you want to remove an item from the scales, simply drag it off the scales and release it in the room. The item is automatically added back to the stock.",
